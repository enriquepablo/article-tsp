    "First we create a random distribution of points in the plane;\n",
    "a distribution that the model has never seen.\n",
    "Then we look for the shortest possible circuit of the points that we can find,\n",
    "which is not necessarily the solution to the instance of the problem;\n",
    "and then we ask the model whether the circuit is actually the shortest,\n",
    "i.e., whether it is the solution,\n",
    "or whether there may be some shorter circuit that we have not found.\n",
    "It is a binary classification task, i.e.,\n",
    "we don't ask the model for a shorter circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our models are producing (percentage) confusion matrices like\n",
    "$\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}61 & 39 \\\\\\\\ 26 & 74\\end{smallmatrix}\\right]$, which, to me, seem significative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the evidence shown is not conclussive,\n",
    "mainly beacuse the data used in the models is taken from instances of the problem with, at most, 31 cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what kind of data we are feeding the ML models,\n",
    "and the significance of the predictions,\n",
    "I provide an introduction in which the TSP is approached from the perspective of the *sorting problem* (SP) - i.e.,\n",
    "the problem that is solved by sorting algorithms.\n",
    "Note that both problems have the same basic form:\n",
    "we want to choose one among all the permutations of a set of elements, according to some criterion.\n",
